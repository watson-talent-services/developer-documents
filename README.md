## Guidelines for Contributing

We put our content into this repository so that you could have access to what we’re working on and to give you a way to give us feedback, fix problems and create issues to connect with us on what you’re seeing here.

In addition to seeing all the content that forms the developer experience, you will see additional things. We will include topics that we call **future** and **experimental**. We include them here so that you can see into what we’re thinking about and working on, so that you can give us your thoughts and feedback while we’re in the process of designing and building it. We want your input to make this platform really great.

## Creating issues and using labels

Using GitHub we hope you will connect with us by creating issues and commenting on issues for any topic here. As part of this, please make use of labels so we know the context of your input. Our labels are;

**feedback** - use this to give us feedback on specific content or in general, telling us what works or what doesn’t, what’s not clear, etc.

**request** - if there’s something that you think we’re missing, please use this label to let us know that you want or need to have this

**defect** - and if there’s errors in wording, spelling, code examples or functionality that just doesn’t cut it, please use this label to call our attention to bugs

You can create an issue by [clicking here](https://github.ibm.com/TMS-Developer-Experience/developer-documents/issues)

## Making a Pull Request

If you’ve got some changes, updates, feedback or bugs you are itching to provide a fix for yourself, please make a **Pull Request** so our team can review and merge.

We use the fork-and-pull GitHub flow. You should fork this repository, configure a remote for your fork, and keep your fork in sync. This is all documented in the Working with forks GitHub documentation.

Once your fork is configured and synced with the latest, you should make your changes on a topic branch, commit those changes, and push the branch to make a **Pull Request**.
