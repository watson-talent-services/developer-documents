# IBM Watson Talent Match 

IBM Watson Talent Match (aka Talent Match) is an API offering that performs Artificial Intelligent (AI) analysis of a 
requisition requirements and an applicant’s resume and returns a Talent Match Score that represents how well an 
applicant’s skills match the requisition’s requirements. Talent Match not only matches skills from a candidate’s profile 
to a requisition but also identifies and analyzes indirect skills and competencies from a candidate’s resume that are not 
explicitly identified. The Talent Match API can parse structured and unstructured data.

Talent Match provides a way for you to submit your job requisition (job data) and applicant resumes (person data) using the 
Talent Match APIs and receive a Talent Match Score that indicates how well an applicant (person) meets the requisition (job) 
requirements. 

![IBM Watson Talent Match API](https://github.com/watson-talent-services/developer-documents/blob/master/images/TalentMatchDiagram.png)

Currently, the Talent Match APIs execute a one-to-one Watson Talent Match. The means the Talent Match API accepts one API call 
at a time that contains a pair (job data and person data) and returns one Talent Match Score. 

Talent Match APIs provide a multi-faceted, cognitive approach to talent acquisition and allow you to:

- Submit raw and / or parsed job and person parameters (data) to the Talent Match API
- Receive Talent Match API responses with Talent Match Scores

### How Does this API Work?

The Talent Match API accepts both raw and parsed job (requisition) and person (applicant) data files. A raw data file is 
simply a file in **text** or **pdf** format. So, a raw job is a job description in text or pdf format and a raw person is a 
resume in text or pdf format. Any new job description or new person file must first be sent as raw data. 

For the raw job parameter, you can provide a text or pdf file of the job description. For the raw person parameter, 
you can provide a text or pdf file resume of the person. The Talent Match API will process this raw content and returns a 
JSON body that has the job and person parsed into JSON. When you send any of the parameter combinations shown below, the 
API returns a parsed job, a parsed person, and a Talent Match Score in json format that indicates how well the person’s 
preferred skills matched the job’s requirements.

The next step in the workflow allows you to send the parsed job and either a raw person or a parsed person to the API endpoint.

When posting to the Talent Match API, you must post in one of the following combinations, the first two parameters for 
each combination are required:

- rawJob, rawPerson, atsJob (optional) and atsPerson (optional)
- rawJob, parsedPerson, atsJob (optional) and atsPerson (optional)
- parsedJob, rawPerson, atsJob (optional), atsPerson (optional)
- parsedJob, parsedPerson, atsJob (optional), atsPerson (optional)

This procedure allows you to send the parsed job and multiple person (raw or parsed) files to the one parsed job to 
obtain a Watson Talent Match. Sending a parsed job and a raw or parsed person allows you to obtain multiple Talent Match 
Scores for one job.

Note: After the Watson Talent Match API processes the job and resume data and returns a Watson Talent Match Score, 
the job and resume are discarded. The parameter data does not persist. Data sent to the Talent Match API is 
encrypted via TLS 1.2.

### Objects

There are 7 objects to consider here;


| Object                   | Description |
| ------------             |:----------- |
| **rawJob**               | this is the unstructured natural language description of a job requistion. |
| **rawPerson**            | this is the unstructured natural language description of a person in terms of their work experience, etc. |
| **parsedJob**            | this is a JSON representation of the job requisition. |
| **parsedPerson**         | this is a JSON representation of the person's work experience.|
| **atsJob**               | this is the JSON input of additional job data coming structured data from sources like ATS, CRM, Job Board etc. |
| **atsPerson**            | this is the JSON input of additional person data coming structured data from sources like ATS, CRM, Job Board etc.  |
| **Match Score Response** | this is the JSON response to the Match call | 

### Using Optional Parameters atsJob and atsPerson

The Job and Person API calls (either of these parameters can be raw or parsed) return the Match Score and limited profile 
details. For example, when you send rawJob and rawPerson parameters, the Match Score json Response details contain matching 
elements, but only contains preferred skills matches and does not include a required skills value. 

To receive a Match Score response that contains a required skills match, you must input the optional parameters atsJob 
and atsPerson with the Job and Person (raw or parsed) parameters. For example, to receive a required skills match you 
can use any of the input parameter combinations, making sure you are including the atsJob and atsPerson parameters.

### IBM Watson Talent Match API Authentication

The Talent Match application uses authentication for secure access to the API. The authentication process requires you 
to obtain client credentials, a Client ID called **X-IBM-Client-Id** and a Client Secret called **X-IBM-Client-Secret-Id**, 
for the Talent Match API. 

You will receive an e-mail once signed-up as a customer and the invitation email includes;

- a URL to access the Talent Match API in the API Explorer application 
- your Client-ID and Secret

Note: API keys authenticate you to your subscription to Talent Match API and it is required that you keep them secure and 
secret. 
Do not share the X-IBM-Client-Secret portion of any API key in publicly accessible places. When you access the Talent Match 
API in the API Explorer application, you use your Client-ID and Secret-ID to authenticate into the application. 
This will allow you to access the API securely. 

Follow these steps to generate your ID and Secret. 

- Select the API Explorer URL in your invitation email. This will open API Explorer landing page.
- Select **Security** in the left side navigation
- Select Pick a Key.
- Locate and select your Client-ID and Secret

![API Explorer Security Screen](https://github.com/watson-talent-services/developer-documents/blob/master/images/APIConnectSecurityScreen.png)

The system authenticates your credentials and you are now ready to use the Talent Match API.

Note: You can manage your keys (credentials) in the API Explorer application by selecting 
**Overview** > **Security** > **Manage your keys** (at the bottom of the page).


Now that you are authenticated into the API Explorer application, you can use the ID and Secret in your authentication 
header is sent with each request.

Here is the required header format:

| API            | /Match       |
| -------------  |:-------------|
| Verb           | POST         |
| Version        | 1.0          | 
| Custom Headers | **clientId** the unique ID of the client for Watson Talent. |
|                | **X-IBM-Client-Id** The Client Id. |
|                | **X-IBM-Client-Secret** The Client Secret. |
| Content-type   | application/json |


When parsing into Match API, you must post one of the following combinations in your payload. The first two parameters for 
each combination are required.

### parsedPerson API Input Schema

**match_PersonParse_Response.json**

A parsedPerson contains the PARSED json representation of the person profile used for matching. It is required that the person passed in this parameter has been parsed first into json format via /match response.
When posting to the Match API, you must post one of the following combinations. The first two parameters for each combination are required.

- rawJob, rawPerson, atsJob (optional) and atsPerson (optional)
- rawJob, parsedPerson, atsJob (optional) and atsPerson (optional)
- parsedJob, rawPerson, atsJob (optional), atsPerson (optional)
- parsedJob, parsedPerson, atsJob (optional), atsPerson (optional)

This section outlines the parsedPerson.
