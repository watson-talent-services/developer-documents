# Talent Frameworks Guide

To understand Talent Frameworks, consider the basic model for jobs and people in an organization. There are many jobs that make up an organization, and each job can be thought of as requiring a set of specific skills. For each skill, there are different levels of proficiency that are tied into that specific job. Similarly, people have a set of skills that reflect their experience, training, education and personality, and a person has a certain proficiency for each skill.

### Talent Frameworks Model

This basic model is at the core of Talent Frameworks.

---

Watson Talent Frameworks also includes interview questions, coaching tips, development goals, and prescriptive learning suggestions for each competency and skill level.

- Job profiles can be customized to meet the needs of your organization.
- Job profiles can be easily deployed across a wide range of HR applications, both IBM and non-IBM.
- New jobs and skills are continually added, curated by Watson.

### Data to infuse Artificial Intelligence (AI) into your HR applications

_Problem_

Machine Learning relies on good data to learn from. It needs consistent “vocabulary” and accurate jobs and skills data. Better the data, more accurate the results will be.

_Solution_

Watson Talent Frameworks provides accurate and comprehensive skills data for thousands of jobs. It provides a solid foundation to build AI applications, from interpreting paper resumes to matching skills to jobs.

### The Talent Frameworks model in-depth

### Frameworks

IBM has developed a concept of **Frameworks**, and has developed sets of these, to structure an entire organization around specific industries. 

![Frameworks](https://github.com/watson-talent-services/developer-documents/blob/tf-publish/images/FrameworksFull.png)

### Job Families

**Frameworks** are made up of sets of **Job Families**.

![Job Families](https://github.com/watson-talent-services/developer-documents/blob/tf-publish/images/JobFamilyDef.png)

Consider this example of a **Framework** for **Banking & Financial Services**, it is composed of many **Job Families**, like Accounting, Mortgage Lending, Investment Services and many more. 

![Job Families](https://github.com/watson-talent-services/developer-documents/blob/tf-publish/images/JobFamilyBankingExample.png)

### Job and Job Profile

A **Job** represents the basic definition of a job in the organization.

A **Job Profile** connects a specific **Job** to those competencies that constitute the **Job**. Each competency in a **Job Profile** needs to indicate a proficiency level. A scale of 0 to 4 is used to represent the proficiency of that competency, with 4 being the highest level (whiule 0 indicates no level at all).

![Job and Profile](https://github.com/watson-talent-services/developer-documents/blob/tf-publish/images/JobAndProfile.png)

### Competency

**Competency** represents the entirety of skills needed for all jobs in the organization and for the skills each person possesses .

![Competency](https://github.com/watson-talent-services/developer-documents/blob/tf-publish/images/Compentencies.png)


**Competency Accelerators** represent items that can help people improve their proficiency in a competency, such as Learning References. **Competency Accelerators** are linked to **Job Profiles** and provide the actions people take to progress their careers.
