# Get Started

Watson can join your team, helping you to find the right people, predict where you need to 
go and help you to develop the careers of the people on your team.

We've introduced our first API, IBM Watson Talent Match API which gives you an API that helps you find matches between a 
person and a job requisition, using Watson. Check out the guide, click

### Design guidance

In addition to the specifics around using IBM Watson Talent Services, you may also be interested in incorporating a

thinking and how you can apply it to the work you undertake by checking out
