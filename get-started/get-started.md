# Get Started

Watson can join your team, helping you to find the right people, predict where you need to 
go and help you to develop the careers of the people on your team.

We've introduced our first API, IBM Watson Talent Match API which gives you an API that helps you find matches between a 
person and a job requisition, using Watson. Check out the guide, click 
[here to learn more.](https://github.com/watson-talent-services/developer-documents/blob/master/developer-guide/v1-talent-match.md)

You can begin your free trial by visting the [IBM Marketplace for the Talent Match API](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/watson-talent-match/details). 

And you can generate your ID and Secret by visiting [Talent Match in API Explorer](https://developer.ibm.com/api/view/watsontalent-prod:watson-talent-match:title-Watson_Talent_Match).
