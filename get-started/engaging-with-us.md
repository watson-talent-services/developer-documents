## Engaging with us

We are continually adding value and want to include you as early as possible in our development process so we can include
your input and feedback. Some features are stable (in that they will not change), others are in progress of being built, 
which we call **beta**, and others are things we are trying out to discover what would work best, which we call 
**experimental**. Additionally, when we are about to introduce something new and want to get feedback on the concepts and 
understanding before we expose APIs, so that your feedback can inform and guide the future API, we will call these 
**future**. Also, **future** may (but not always) include the ability for you to play with an API, through one of our tools, 
so you can have some experience with it and give us feedback to help inform and improve things.

APIs that are going to be going out of service will be called **deprecated**, which means that while this is still available
for developers to use, it will be removed and calls to this API will no longer work. They will be kept on to provide backward
compatibility, and to provide time for developers to update affected code.

You will see these various categories called out on those specific APIs. All other, undecorated API references are
considered published and are fully supported.

To provide more transparency in how we’re working and what we’re building, we will surface our content in markdown files in
the GitHub repo so that you can engage with us through GitHub to inform and provide feedback to help make and design great APIs.

In providing feedback let us know what sort of feedback you’re giving us, such as:

- something wrong or incorrect
- something confusing with the documentation or results experienced with an API
- in the cases where we’ve published something that is **experimental**, **beta**, or **future**, please provide a comment or reaction to what we’re saying
- provide suggestions to things we may have left out that you believe we should include
- and really any other thoughts you want to share with us

To provide feedback, if it’s on an existing document or the API related to it, please create a fork and make your own changes and comments and create a Pull Request to draw our attention. If you want to comment in general or give us general feedback not directly related to documentation files, please create an issue. Also, create issues if you have suggestions for us in terms of Tutorials or code examples you’d like to see.
